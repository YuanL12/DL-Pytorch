# Batch normalization
- Standanardization on a small batch used to preserve numerical stability.
- Scale parameter  ùú∏  and shift parameter ùú∑ have the same shape as  ùê±  and we learn them jointly with the other model parameters.
- Since batch size equals to one will learn nothing, choice of batch size may be even more significant than without batch normalization.
- Batch normalization seems to allow for more **aggressive learning rates**.

## Utility Analysis
Batch-normalization is a useful method in practical use, which can be explained by:
- Standanardization on a small batch will induce noise (since a small datasets might contain high noise).
- Learned Scale parameter  ùú∏  and shift parameter ùú∑ change slowly depending on learning rate. 

Thus, in some sense, it controls model's complexity.


## Layer position and how to use
### Position
***Takeaway: Linear things should be put together.***

Put Batch-normalization layer 
1. after the output of FCL or Convolutional Layer and before activation function. 
2. before the output of FCL or Convolutional Layer and after activation function. 
### How to use
Apply Batch-normalization layer to 
1. FCL: on features of each row. For example, if $X$ is a $m\times n$ input with each row is a data point with $n$ features, then we apply Batch-normalization for each feature.
2. Convolutional Layer: standardization over all values on each channel, i.e., take the mean for each channel (over all samples, height and weight.)



## Define function
```Python
import torch
from torch import nn
from d2l import torch as d2l

def batch_norm(X, gamma, beta, moving_mean, moving_var, eps, momentum):
    '''
    moving_mean and moving_var are exponential moving average functioning similar as global mean and variance over the whole dataset instead of a batch.
    '''


    # Use `is_grad_enabled` to determine whether the current mode is training
    # or doing inference/prediction
    if not torch.is_grad_enabled():
        # If it is prediction mode, directly use the mean and variance
        # obtained by moving average
        X_hat = (X - moving_mean) / torch.sqrt(moving_var + eps)
    else:
        assert len(X.shape) in (2, 4)
        if len(X.shape) == 2:
            # When using a fully-connected layer, calculate the mean and
            # variance on the feature dimension
            mean = X.mean(dim=0)
            var = ((X - mean)**2).mean(dim=0)
        else:
            # When using a two-dimensional convolutional layer, calculate the
            # mean and variance on the channel dimension (axis=1). Here we
            # need to maintain the shape of `X`, so that the broadcasting
            # operation can be carried out later
            mean = X.mean(dim=(0, 2, 3), keepdim=True)
            # return shape is (1, n_channels, 1, 1)
            var = ((X - mean)**2).mean(dim=(0, 2, 3), keepdim=True)
        # In training mode, the current mean and variance are used for the
        # standardization
        X_hat = (X - mean) / torch.sqrt(var + eps)
        # Update the mean and variance using moving average
        moving_mean = momentum * moving_mean + (1.0 - momentum) * mean
        moving_var = momentum * moving_var + (1.0 - momentum) * var

    # return output Y
    Y = gamma * X_hat + beta  # Scale and shift
    return Y, moving_mean.data, moving_var.data
```

## Define Layer
```Python
class BatchNorm(nn.Module):
    # `num_features`: the number of outputs for a fully-connected layer
    # or the number of output channels for a convolutional layer. `num_dims`:
    # 2 for a fully-connected layer and 4 for a convolutional layer
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_dims):
        super().__init__()
        if num_dims == 2:
            shape = (1, num_features)
        else:
            shape = (1, num_features, 1, 1)
        # The scale parameter and the shift parameter (model parameters) are
        # initialized to 1 and 0, respectively
        self.gamma = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(shape))
        self.beta = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(shape))
        # The variables that are not model parameters are initialized to 0 and 1
        self.moving_mean = torch.zeros(shape)
        self.moving_var = torch.ones(shape)

    def forward(self, X):
        # If `X` is not on the main memory, copy `moving_mean` and
        # `moving_var` to the device where `X` is located
        if self.moving_mean.device != X.device:
            self.moving_mean = self.moving_mean.to(X.device)
            self.moving_var = self.moving_var.to(X.device)
        # Save the updated `moving_mean` and `moving_var`
        Y, self.moving_mean, self.moving_var = batch_norm(
            X, self.gamma, self.beta, self.moving_mean, self.moving_var,
            eps=1e-5, momentum=0.9)
        return Y
```

## Define NN
```Python
net = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(1, 6, kernel_size=5), 
    BatchNorm(6, num_dims=4),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    nn.Conv2d(6, 16, kernel_size=5), 
    BatchNorm(16, num_dims=4),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    nn.Flatten(), nn.Linear(16 * 4 * 4, 120),
    BatchNorm(120, num_dims=2), nn.Sigmoid(),
    nn.Linear(120, 84), BatchNorm(84, num_dims=2),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.Linear(84, 10))
```

## Train
Using larger `lr` than LeNet 
```Python
lr, num_epochs, batch_size = 1.0, 10, 256
train_iter, test_iter = d2l.load_data_fashion_mnist(batch_size)
d2l.train_ch6(net, train_iter, test_iter, num_epochs, lr, d2l.try_gpu())
```

## Concise implementation
No need to specify `num_dims`
```Python
net = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(1, 6, kernel_size=5), nn.BatchNorm2d(6),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    nn.Conv2d(6, 16, kernel_size=5), nn.BatchNorm2d(16),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    nn.Flatten(), nn.Linear(256, 120), nn.BatchNorm1d(120),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.Linear(120, 84), nn.BatchNorm1d(84),
    nn.Sigmoid(), nn.Linear(84, 10))

d2l.train_ch6(net, train_iter, test_iter, num_epochs, lr, d2l.try_gpu())
```
