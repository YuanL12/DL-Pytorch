## Training Data
Optimize loss function by updating parameters, weight and bias, continuously


## Validation Data
Used to select hyperparameters like the number of layers and nodes. k-fold cross validation is used to select hyperparameters when dataset is not sufficient or very small. 


## Test Data
It is often with unknown label or is unavailable when training. It is used to finally evaulate. (e.g., the final dataset used to rank every team's model)

## Notice
In real case, people will often confuse the idea of test and validation data.
