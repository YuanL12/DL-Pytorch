Suppose
1. batch size is 256
2. there are 10 classes to be classfied
3. Each $28 \times 28$ is flattened into a vector with size 784

Then
$$
X \in \mathbb{R}^{256 \times 784}, W \in \mathbb{R}^{784 \times 10} , b \in \mathbb{R}^{256 \times 10}
$$ 

$$
\hat{y} = XW + b 
$$

Every row of $X$ is a data point.
