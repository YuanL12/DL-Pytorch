1. Pytorch needs to compute the input and output size, instead of using symbolic notation in Keras. We can print output size, but inconvenient.
2. Batch size does not need to be specified in the definition of nn.Sequential. We only need to specify input and output channel.
3. Even if a NN uses same layers multiples times, we should still define they separately with different names, e.g., [[ResNet#Define Residual Block]]. Because their parameters are different!!
