# Dynamical system
## Intro
Primary focus is to solve ODEs:
$\dot{X} = f(X; \mu)$, also called  parameterised family of dynamic systems, $\mu$ is the parameter. Solution is called **trajectory**. 

If $\dot{X} = f(X)$ and $f$ is time-independent, then it is called autonomous.

If $\dot{X} = f(X,t)$ and $f$ is explicitlt time-dependent, then it is called non-autonomous.

**Dynamical system** is an evolution rule that defines a trajectory as a function of a single real parameter (time) on a set of states or the phase space. 

For example,
$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = \hat{x_1} \text{, if } x(0) \in S_1\\
\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = \hat{x_2} \text{, if } x(0) \in S_2
$$
Bistable system, $S_1, S_2$ are basins of attraction for $x_1, x_2$

e.g. $m \dot{X} = f(x) , x\in \mathbb{R}$ let
$$
\dot{X}=v\\
\dot{v}=\frac{1}{m} f(x)
